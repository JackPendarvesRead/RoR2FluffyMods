# WikiOfRain

Do you want to be more smarter like I are? Now you can be smart like me by reading wikipedia whilst you play.

This mod will read a random wikipedia page and play it back to you in chat one sentence at a time on a timer.

This is an early version of this mod which hasn't had extensive testing so it is quite likely you will find some weirdness, please do let me know if you find any such weirdness.

Happy learnings!

Enjoy,
Thanks

## Configuration

This mod was written for Bepinex#150+ which is as yet unreleased. Therefore there is no configuration in this build until the new bepinex build is released. 

## Installation:

Requires intallation of Bepinex and R2API. 

Place `WikiOfRain` folder inside of "/Risk of Rain 2/Bepinex/Plugins/"
This folder should contain `WikiOfRain.dll`, `WebHtmlParser.dll` and `HtmlAgilityPack.dll`

## Contact

If you have any issues you can usually find me on the ROR2 modding discord (@Fluffatron). Please bear in mind that as with all mods here this is something I do in my spare time so may not always be able to immediately fix any issues that you come up with.
