#BackupEngiTurrets

Backup Magazines also increase the max number of turrets an engineer can hold (does not affect the number which can be placed).

This is a mod made because I thought that backup magazines are next to useless for an Engineer. 
I thought it would be a nice addition to allow engineer to stock more turrets with more backup magazines.
This does NOT effect the number of turrets which can be placed - it only allows you to stock more.

E.g. Engineer base stock for turrets = 2. If an Engineer has 2 BackupMagazine in inventory then the max stock increases to 4.

The Engineer Turret is the main focus of this hook but this also gives us the capability of editing other similar abilities.
I have also added a configuration which when set to true will apply the same stock logic to Mage FireBolt ability.
More can be added to this if the need arises but for now I cannot think of any other abilities which would be "balanced" to be able to add more.

Please let me know your thoughts, if any needs to change or could be improved.

Thanks
