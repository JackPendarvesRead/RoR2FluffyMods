# NOTE: THIS IS A BETA RELEASE

You will need the "experimental" BepInEx pack in order to use this mod. Ask in #development channel of the modding discord channel for the latest pack.

# ReEnergisedDrink

I recently was made aware that in the current state of the game that after the first energy drink it is strictly better to take goat hoof. That is you actually get more speed sprinting per stack from a goat hoof than another energy drink. This simply will not do.

This mod rebalances Energy Drink so that it scales better than hoof for sprint speed. You will get less initial bonus from the first item you pick up but the scaling of each energy drink is better than before. This is also configurable if you want to make your own balance.

Enjoy,
Thanks

## Installation:

Requires intallation of Bepinex and R2API.
