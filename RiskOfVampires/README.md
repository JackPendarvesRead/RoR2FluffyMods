# RiskOfVampirism

Power at any price. Make a sacrifice to gain powerful vampiric abilities.  

As a vampire you gain a powerful lifesteal effect but in order to stay alive you must feed. The more you kill the more powerful you become but also the more your hunger grows. 

This mod changes the way you play in which you must be constantly searching for enemies to leech off or face an inevitable death. It changes the pacing in a way that forces you to move quickly and keep killing. You gain health for each kill, which does make you more powerful but degeneration is based on your maximum health so the more you kill the stronger your hunger is and the more you have to kill to stay alive. Can you beat it?

Vampire abilities:
- % lifesteal on hitting enemies  
- Gain 1 max hp for each enemy kill
- Lose all regeneration (including from items e.g. slug)
- Life degenerates over time

Any survivor class is viable to be a vampire. Try them all, configure the values to your taste. Happy feeding. 

Good luck. BLEH BLEH BLEHHH!

Enjoy,
Thanks

# A note on balance

I am quite aware that this is not a fine tuned and balanced experience. For this reason I have supplied you with configurations to customise your experience. If you turn on Advanced Settings in the configuration manager you will also have access to a slider which will buff/nerf each survivor independently!

This is work in progress so if you have any feedback or suggestions they are very welcome.
