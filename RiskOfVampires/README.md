# RiskOfVampirism

Power at any price. Make a sacrifice to gain powerful vampiric abilities.  

As a vampire you gain a powerful lifesteal effect but in order to stay alive you must feed. The more you kill the more powerful you become but also the more your hunger grows. 

This mod changes the way you play in which you must be constantly searching for enemies to leech off or face an inevitable death. It changes the pacing in a way that forces you to move quickly and keep killing. You gain health for each kill, which does make you more powerful but degeneration is based on your maximum health so the more you kill the stronger your hunger is and the more you have to kill to stay alive. Can you beat it?

Vampire abilities:
- % lifesteal on hitting enemies  
- Gain 1 max hp for each enemy kill
- Lose all regeneration (including from items e.g. slug)
- Life degenerates over time

Any survivor class is viable to be a vampire with the exception of engineer which has a very difficult time staying alive seeing as the majority of damage comes from their turrets which do not leech life to you.  

Good luck. BLEH BLEH BLEHHH!

Enjoy,
Thanks

## Installation:

Requires intallation of Bepinex and R2API. 

Place `RiskOfVampirism.dll` inside of "/Risk of Rain 2/Bepinex/Plugins/"

## Upcoming?  

I feel like a similar idea to this could make a good lunar item. Perhaps at some point I may adapt this into an item rather than a permanent starting effect.
